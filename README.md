# Debian-Internet-Sharing
This is a python script to setup connection sharing from your internet-facing interface to a USB/RNDIS Device. This was originally made to be used on Debain 12 and a [WiFi Pineapple](https://shop.hak5.org/products/wifi-pineapple) but this can be used on other devices as well.
